# Terminal Seed Picker
*Everyone needs this mod installed in order to work!*

Adds 2 new commands to the terminal in the OTHER category,

`set seed [SEED]` 

and 

`get seed`

You can put raw numbers or a word (no spaces) into the `set seed` command.

Words are converted into a number to be used for the seed similar to Minecraft.

`get seed` will give you info on the current seed, pretty simple.
